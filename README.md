I am a software development enthusiast, dedicating myself to specialize in Full-Stack development.

I have extensive experience working with cutting-edge technologies, including NestJS, Java - Spring Boot, .NET, ReactJS, NextJS, VueJS, AngularJS, React Native, and GraphQL.

My goal is to create robust, resilient, and scalable applications, adhering to principles such as SOLID, DDD, and design patterns like CQRS, MVVM, and Microservices.

I embrace software development best practices, such as Clean Code and Clean Architecture, to ensure that my code is simple, easily understandable, and optimized.

I am always on the lookout for challenges that allow me to enhance my skills and contribute to successful projects. Please feel free to contact me to discuss collaboration opportunities or to learn more about my work.
