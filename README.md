I am a software development enthusiast, passionate about creating innovative and efficient solutions. As a Full-Stack Developer, I work across all stages of the development process, from front-end to back-end. My projects are available on GitHub, and I am always open to new ideas and collaborations.

I have experience with various technologies, such as AngularJS, ReactJS, NextJS, React Native, GraphQL, .NET, NestJS, and Java with Spring Boot, which has provided me with a solid technical foundation and broad knowledge in application development.

My focus is on creating high-quality, resilient, and scalable applications, using principles like SOLID, Domain-Driven Design (DDD), and patterns such as MVC and Microservices. I adopt best practices like Clean Code and Clean Architecture to ensure efficient, readable, and optimized code.

I believe challenges are opportunities for growth and improvement. If you're interested in collaborations or exchanging ideas, feel free to reach out!
