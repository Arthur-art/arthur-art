I am a software development enthusiast, passionate about creating innovative and efficient solutions. As a Full-Stack Developer, I work across all stages of the development process, from front-end to back-end.  
You can explore some of my projects and check out my portfolio on GitHub. I’m always open to new ideas and collaborations!  

Throughout my professional journey, I have had the opportunity to work with a variety of technologies, including AngularJS, ReactJS, NextJS, React Native, GraphQL, .NET, NestJS, and Java with Spring Boot. This diverse experience has provided me with a solid technical foundation and a comprehensive understanding of application development.  

My primary goal is to develop high-quality, resilient, and scalable applications. To achieve this, I follow fundamental principles such as SOLID and Domain-Driven Design (DDD), as well as design patterns like MVC, MVVM, and Microservices. This approach enables me to create robust systems that adapt to business needs.  

I am a strong advocate for best practices in software development. Therefore, I adopt both Clean Code and Clean Architecture principles, ensuring that my code is not only efficient but also easy to understand and optimized for its specific purpose.  

I believe new challenges are valuable opportunities to grow and refine my skills while contributing to the success of the projects I work on. If you’re interested in discussing collaboration opportunities or learning more about my work, feel free to reach out. I’m always happy to exchange ideas and information!
